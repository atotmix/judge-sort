# judge-sort


`judge-sort` is a python script designed to make the sorting & grouping of judges easy based off a wide range of variables.

## Key features

- Automatically identifies conflicts of interest based on company associations, brand involvement, and other criteria.
- Dynamically assigns judges to teams, ensuring diversity in terms of company type, job role, seniority, and more.
- Data Validation and Cleaning: Processes and validates input data to ensure accuracy and completeness before allocation.
- Supports flexible team size configurations.
- Exports team assignments and conflict summaries to Excel files for easy review.

## Development
Whilst developing this tool, I used github projects to create simple to understand tickets. I chose to use github projects as it very closely links with the rest of github, letting me track progress within pull requests / issues

Whilst writing these tickets, I aimed to write them as cronologically as possible, this means that I am able to go ticket - by - ticket

As I progress throughout the project I update each ticket, making it far easier to track progress & understand what part of the program is next.
